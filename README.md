# Staff-Management-System-GROUP-48
Our staff management system works as a database to record information of every employee in the company. 

Information recorded includes: 
- name 
- employee ID 
- age 
- length of time at the company
- position 
- contact details
- working shift
- attendance
- work and education history
- key performance indicator
- salary 

This system aims to help the HR department and the managers to keep track of employee information. At the same time, basic information of every employee is available to others, accessible through a search system. Personal information such as work experience, education history and salary will be confidential and only accessible by the HR department and superiors. Thus, we will implement a user ID (employee ID) and password system where the user ID would be the determinant of the staffâ€™s access to confidential information.

This system will implement a low-level KPI ranking system where employees in the sales department will be able to view their ranking in a leaderboard. The KPI system will be helpful for performance evaluation for the employees themselves. This information could also be useful for the superiors when making decisions for a wage related matters. All commonly inquired information are in the system which makes information retrieval smooth and efficient. 

The HR department, first-line managers, middle managers and top managers maintain and contribute to this staff management system. Only personnels from the HR department and those who hold managerial positions can edit, add new and remove data in this system.
