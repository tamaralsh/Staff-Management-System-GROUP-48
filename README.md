# Staff-Management-System-GROUP-48
Our staff management system works as a database to record information of every employee in the company. Information recorded includes: name, employee ID, age, length of time at the company, position, contact details, working shift, attendance, work and education history, key performance indicator and their salary. This system aims to help the HR department and the managers to keep track of employee information. At the same time, basic information of every employee is available to others, accessible through a search system. Personal information such as work experience, education history and salary will be confidential and only accessible by the HR department and superiors. Thus, we will implement a user ID (employee ID) and password system where the user ID would be the determinant of the staffâ€™s access to confidential information.
